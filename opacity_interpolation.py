Develop a program, by interpolation in a table, for caculating the opacity of a
gas with a given density and temperature, and with the chemical compoistion that you
will use for the stellar model.

What do you obtain for the opacity in (cm^2 g^-1) for:
    (a) log T = 6.3 K, log row = 0.3 (cgs)
    (a) log T = 5.0 K, log row = -4.0 (cgs)

The temperature range you will need for the stellar models runs from 5x10^3 to 3x10^7 K,
and the dnesity range from 10^-9 to 10^3 g cm^-3, depending ong T.
