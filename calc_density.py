Problem Set 1, Problem 5.

Develop a simple numerical program to calculate the density, given the pressure,
temperature, and X, Y, and Z. Include radiation pressue and assume the gas is
fully ionized. Evalute the density for:

    (a) X=0.00, Y=0.98, log T = 7.55, log P = 16.85 (cgs)
    (b) X=0.70, Y=0.28, log T = 6.91, log P = 16.87 (cgs)

What is Beta, the ratio of gas pressure to total pressure in each case?
